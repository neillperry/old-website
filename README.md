## Details
This is my website. It highlights my skills and achievements as a software developer, and it allows me to practice HTML and CSS. The homepage offers a basic introduction of who I am and what skills I offer.  There will be a page that highlights my portfolio of past projects and another page that hosts my blog, where I will write about various tech topics of interest.  

## About
I am a junior software developer. Over the past six months, I have worked in both web and mobile development. I have experience with Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, Active Record, PostgreSQL, Objective C and Swift. I have experience on team and solo projects.
