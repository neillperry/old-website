  <h1>Interactive Design</h1>
	<aside>March 31, 2017</aside>

	  <p>For this post, I am going to explore a few of the elements of interactive design</p>

		<p>Human-computer interaction (HCI) "involves understanding, evaluating and implementing interactive computer systems for human use."  As defined by Dix (1998), it is "the discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computer systems for human use and the study of major phenomena surrounding them." HCI is not limited to just personal computers, but extends to other areas of technology such as microwaves, watches, ovens, televisions. It involves how information is passed from the user to the computer and the return trip back to the user. It appears to focus on improving how humans interact with technology to improve efficiency and performance.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>"It lies at the intersection between the social and cognitive science on the one hand, and computer science and technology on the oher.""</li>
			<li>It focuses on "the engineering goabl of improving the usability of computers"</li>
			<li>It touches on a host of disciplines, such as ergonomics, cognitive engineers, web designers, GUI designers, etc.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Human-computer interface "involves those aspects of a system that the user interacts with.  It is part of the computer system that provides access to a computer's internal resources.  This is a technology rather than a research area." In other words, it's the part of the system that provides access. For example, the digital thermostat provides access to HVAC controls.</p>

    <p>Interactive systems are playing a larger role in computing. Decades ago, only a limited number of specialists accessed a computer. Later, it expanded to a core group of engineers and academics. Finally, it's available to almost everyone. Additionally, computing power has increased, whcih means that designers need to facilitate greater use of increasingly powerful computers by a growing body of untrained users. And what designers need to do is facilitate that interaction and optimize user experience.</p>

    <p>An example of user interaction is the self-checkout scanners at grocery stores or the ticket kiosks at airports. The system needs to be designed in a way that makes for an effective, efficient system; otherwise, people will get frustrated at the system and resolve their needs with a human employee, thereby wasting time.</p>

		<p>The user's experience is central to interaction design. The designer needs to account for how the product behaves and how do people use it in the real world. </p>
