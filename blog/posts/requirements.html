  <h1>User Requirements</h1>
	<aside>May 20, 2017</aside>

  <p>Let's talk about eliciting user requirements.</p>

  <p>No matter which method you use, one of the first things that you will need to do when developing software is elicit user requirements - after the feasibility study, of course. Requirements are important because they will lay the foundation to the design of your software and because they are integral to contractual agreements between you and the customers.</p>

  <p>Sommerville (2007) defines requirements as "the description of the services provided by the system and its operational constraints," but also warns  The requirements represent the solution to a customer's problem. Maybe customers need software that accepts merchandise orders and credit card payments. Or maybe they need software that allows the sending and receiving of emails and instant messages.</p>

  <p>Sommerville splits requirements into two categories: user and system. According to him, user requirements are expressed in broad, high-level, plain English terms. System requirements, on the other hand, are detailed and precise. Sommerville has a great point about user requirements. Sometimes there is not one user, but a group of users with different needs. So a manager may not need the system requirements but the IT staff may.</p>

  <p>Eliciting requirements - as Sommerville states again, there may be more than one user. In fact, he uses the term stakeholders to describe the different folks with an interest in the new product. And here is his list on why eliciting requirements is difficult: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Stakeholders don't know what they want. At best, they have a vague idea of what they need.</li>
    <li>Stakeholders explain things in their own language and terms, which may include industry jargon.</li>
    <li>Different stakeholders have different requirements, and sometimes those requirements conflict with each other.</li>
    <li>Internal company politics - a manager wants things that may benefit serve her interets.</li>
    <li>Requirements may change during development.</li>
  </ol>

	<p>Before moving on, I'd like to add my own personal experience with user requirements. At Flatiron, for the final project we were teamed with a government agency for developing a application. The guidance we got was pretty vague, and I'm not sure whose fault that was. The best we could figure out was make app that relates to the agency's core mission. We did our best. My only other experience with user requirements comes from side projects, and when I undertake my own apps, I rarely know what I want to do with the app. I have a foggy notion of what I want it to do, but nothing concrete. So in those instances, i am my own customer.</p>

  <p>Sommerville delves pretty deep into what he calls requirements engineering, even going so far as to delineate a four phase model - discovery, classification and organization, prioritization and negotiation, and finallly documentation. </p>

	<p><u>Discovery Phase</u> - Sommerville walks us through a viewpoint-oriented approach to fleshing out requirements, and he uses an example of designing an ATM. There are a lot of people whose jobs directly or indirectly affect and are affected by that ATM's functionality. Under VO, you'd have to get their input as part of the process.</p>

	<h3>Eliciting Requirements</h3>

	<p><b>Interviews:</b> This is a pretty standard way to elicit information from stakeholders - asking them either open or close-ended questions. Sommervile warns that although interviews are good for getting an overall understanding of requirements, they are not so good for uncovering requirements "from the application domain." He attributes this to the different terminology and jargon that the customer uses, and which the engineer may misunderstand. He also cautions that interviews are bad for getting informatoin about organizational requirements and constraints because those may be too nuanced or subtle to uncover via questions.</p>

	<p><b>Scenarios / Use cases:</b> Use cases are a subset of scenarios, so I'll lump them all together. Scenarios can provide a concrete example of how the application is supposed to function, flow, handle errors, and finish. Sommerville notes that scenarios are integral to agile / extreme programming, and that has certainly been my experience. Use cases in particular are fundamental to UML (I have no idea what that is yet; that's coming up in another chapter) "for describing object-oriented system models." </p>

	<aside>The course guide mentions that agile development elicits requirements in ways other than asking at the onset of the project. RAD and agile processes integrate the user into the team, so they are able to access the requirements throughout the process instead of all at once in the beginning. </aside>

	<p><b>Ethnography:</b> finally, Sommerville discusses ethnography, which is watching the customers work in the wild. Under this approach, you immerse yourself in their own work environment and find out the things that the stakeholders and users didn't tell you, couldn't tell you. This is how you find out hte important, unspoken details that your program needs to handle.</p>
