  <h1>Customers and Information and Communication Technology</h1>
	<aside>May 22, 2017</aside>

  <p>Come with me on a magical journey away from the land of algorithms and depedencies to the land of information systems development and management. These are sea tales from ye old country, passed down from step-father to adopted bastard street urchin. Magic, wonder, enchantments and spells - it's all true!</p>

  <p>Today I thought I would take a break from Software Engineering practice exam questions and crack open my Info Sys course to start looking at those exam questions. I don't want to neglect that topic. Today's topic is <u>'critically discuss the capacity of information and communication technology (ICT) to empower consumers.'</u> Here goes nothing.</p>

  <p>A different way to approach this question is from the public sector. Although the question mentions 'consumers,' and thus could be limited to the private sector, it's also worth exploring how ICT empowers consumers of government services. Layne and Lee (2001) discuss the four-stage development of e-government, which is helpful to highlight here. In the first stage of cataloguing, citizens can access the static web pages of government agencies to get information and forms. In the second phase of transaction, citizens can transact via web applications that connect back to the database. "Citizens may renew their licenses and pay fines online" The third and fourth phases of development are horizontal and vertical integration. Vertical integration refers to different levels of government - local, state, federal - while horizontal integration refers to different agencies with different missions. Layne and Lee offer an example of someone who renews her driver's license, which automatically links to the national database of license truckers. </p>

  <p>In my experience, I have see the third phase of development where there is horizontal integration across one level, namely the state. I recall using the <a href="http://www.myflorida.com">My Florida</a> website that offers Florida residents all kinds of state level services. It does not appear that any of those are integrated to a higher level, but that would not always be possible because some government functions are exclusive to a particular level, i.e., only the feds issues passports, only states issue drivers' licenses.</p>

  <p>In any event, easier access of government services is tremendously powerful, especially to people with mobility issues. </p>

  <p>In the private sector, ICT empowers customers by giving them greater choices and a source for feedback. The internet provides more choices to citizens than what they might find in there local area. Curiously, consumers do not always avail themselves of these choices. I read an article about how rural America still goes to shopping malls even though they could buy everything they need online, and sometimes more cheaply. I couldn't find the article (I swear it's WSJ), but I think it goes to how uneven adoption of technology tempers the advantages of new technology.<p>
