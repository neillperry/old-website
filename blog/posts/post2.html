	<h1>App Store Review Guidelines</h1>

<h2>Intro to the Guidelines</h2>
	<p>For my second blog post, I will be reviewing the App Store guidelines. All submissions to the App Store must be reviewed and approved prior to distribution.  These guidelines encapsulate basic common sense as well as accessibility concerns and performance standards. All the legal jargon outlined in the guidelines boil down to take care of your customer's data, don't try to rip them off and don't try to rip off Apple. If it seems sneaky or underhanded, then it's probably against the rules. That being said, there are a lot of guidelines that are not intuitively obvious, such as making sure your use of a minor's data complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

	<p>Before moving on to the meat of the guidelines, it is important to remember that these are not the only guidelines that your app must satisfy.  In addition to these, there are development guidelines, design guidelines, and brand and marketing guidelines. For example, there is an iTunes Connect Developer Guide.</p>

<h4>The Comic Book Version</h4>

	<p>Curiously, Apple has also formatted these guidelines into a comic book fashion.  However, unlike most comic books, this one has no plot adn no characters.  The dialogue consists of paragraphs lifted straight from the guidelines.  It might be more aesthetically pleasing, but it is not a comic book. </p>


<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Don't cheat Apple, other developers or your customers</li>
	<li>Follow the law - privacy, gambling, intellectual property</li>
</ol>



<h3>Safety</h3>
	<img id="photo" src="https://chainsawbucktooth.github.io/safety.png" alt="Smiley face">

<p>Don't publish objecitonable content, such as animals or people being tortured, killed or maimed; images that encourage useless or reckless use of weapons; no pornographic or sexually explicit imagees.  However, there is an exception if content is from web-based service and it is by default turned off</p>

<p>Refraining from objectionable content also extends to user-generated content.  If users are allowed to submit and publish content, then the app must have a way to filter objectionable content, a mechanism to report it, the ability to block and a means for consumers to contact the developer.</p>

<p>No racial profiling - game 'enemies' cannot be all of same race, culture, corporation.</p>

<p>Do not misquote religious texts.</p>

<p>No pranks - even for entertainment purposes, i.e., false location trackers, inaccurate device data</p>

<p>Do not objectify people - 'hot or not' voting apps</p>

<p>Apps may not cause physical harm to users.  Do not encourage illegal or underage drug use, don't publish undisclosed DUI checkpoints, and don't encourage users to place the iPhone under a mattress or a pillow.  Medical apps must provide accurate diagnosis or treatment information.  There must also be a support URL that allows people a way to contact you.</p>



<h3>Performance</h3>

<img id="photo" src="https://chainsawbucktooth.github.io/performance.png" alt="Smiley face">

<p>The application must be fully functional with placeholder text and temporary content deleted prior to submission.  The App Review is not a free software testing service.  When you submit the app, declare what it is about and if any in-app purchases are required.  Don't hide features from reviewers.  App previews must show screen shots of the app in use and any video previews must adhere to a 4+ age rating.</p>

<p>Don't include references to other mobile platforms - Android, Samsung - unless there's a specific reason to do so.</p>

<p>Your app should be power efficient and it should never suggest or require restart of the device.</p>

<p>Apps that browse the internet must use WebKit Javascript and WebKit.  The app may only use public APIs, it may only use background services for their intended purpose, it may not request privilege escalation or transmit malware. Apps may not alter the functions of switches such as the Volume Up / Down switches.</p>



<h3>Business</h3>

<p>Don't be shady.  Be clear and upfront about your business model.  Don't try to rip-off users with irrationally high prices.  Do not manipulate App Store reviews or inflate chart rankings with fake feedback. Do not force users to rate or review your app to unlock features or content. All purchases must be in app purchases. Do not send users outside of your app, i.e., to your sketchy website.  You cannot create your own methods to unlock app content, such as license keys, QR codes, etc. </p>

<p>There's a whole bunch of guidelines on subscription procedures. Read them.</p>

<p>May not arbitrarily restrict who may use the app, such as by location or carrier.</p>


<h3>Design</h3>

<img id="photo" src="https://chainsawbucktooth.github.io/design.png" alt="Smiley face">

<p>Don't be a punk to other developers.  Don't steal someone else's app and don't submit apps that are just plain creepy.  Your app had better be more than a repackaged website, more than just marketing materials (unless it's a catalog) and more than just a watch face.</p>

<p>Note: Make sure your app conforms to other App Guidelines</p>


<h3>Legal</h3>

<img id="photo" src="https://chainsawbucktooth.github.io/legal.png" alt="Smiley face">

<p>Your app may implicate a variety of legal issues - privacy laws, intellectual privacy, gambling laws, etc.  Make sure your app complies with all of them.  If you collect the user's data, you must have a privacy policy in place and obtain the users' consent to collect beforehand.  If you use minor's data (age < 18), then you must comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.  You may only use content to which you have a license.  Do not facilitate illegal file sharing.  If your app involves gambling, make sure your app complies with all rules and regulations.</p>
