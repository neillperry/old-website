<h2>1. Swift Documentation</h2>


<p>Apple makes extensive resources available on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple Community</a>.

First, there is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/">Swift documentation</a> itself. This has all the authoritative information on Swift code and syntax. I refer to the site constantly to supplement lecutres and readings or to learn more about a particular topic. For example, one area that I struggle with is figuring out which instance method to use; there are so many out there. So sometimes I will just look up 'Array' and read through all the instance methods so I know what is out there. </p>

<h2>2. Sample Code</h2>

<p>Second, Apple makes sample code available for developers.  For example, they have posted <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/samplecode/SpeedySloth/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017338">sample code for using HealthKit</a> to build a workout app for Apple Watch. (HealthKit is the developer platform that Jacqueline presented last week.) Looking through the sample code repositories, I noted that there is not much documentation on how it works, so you are kind of on your own in using this.</p>

<br>

<h2>3. Developer Forums</h2>
Third, Apple hosts chat forums for its developers where they can ask and respond to questions and issues.

<br>
<p>One piece of advice: when searching for help on Swift / Xcode / Dev issues, I strongly recommend beginning your search from the Apple Developer Forum.  If you search using Google, then you will likely end up at Stack Overflow, which may be a result of Stack having a higher web traffic.  Another benefit of using the Apple Forums is that they have more current information. Stack Overflow has limited answers dealing with Swift 3.</p>

<h2>4. Design / WWDC Videos</h2>
Next, Apple offers a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/design/">library of videos</a>.  For instance, there are videos from the annual <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2016">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>. I found a great 40 minute lecture on using Keynote to prototype <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/design/23/">app layouts and workflows</a>.  </p>

<h2>5. Registered Developers </h2>

 <p>Finally, Apple offers additional features for registered developers.  A registered developer is an individual or business that has paid an annual fee and who has had a verified address. (The cost to register as an individual is $99.) Only registered developers can deploy applications to the App Store, but there are other advantages that come with membership. For instance, you can use TestFlight, which allows you to upload your beta project and invite up to 2,000 people to test run your application before deployment. Additionally, registered developers get access to beta versions of new software  prior to release, such as macOS Sierra and Xcode 8.</p>

 <p> For this blog post, I was going to register as an Apple Developer, but I read that the annual fee is non-refundable, so I had to quash that idea.</p>
