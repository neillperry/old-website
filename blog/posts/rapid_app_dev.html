  <h1>Rapid Application Development</h1>
	<aside>May 8, 2017</aside>
    <p><em>Unless otherwise noted, all quotes are from Sommerville 2007.</em></p>

	  <p>In this week's blog post, I will be talking about Rapid Application Development and contrasting it with the spiral model of system development.</p>

    <p>As you have heard, rapid applicaiton development (RAD) is all the rage among the youth. Go to any discoteque or skating rink, and you will hear teenagers weigh the pros and cons of RAD. Many parents are concerned that their children are experimenting with non-traditional software development processes. To allay their fears, I have written up the following.</p>

    <p>Rapid development is just one example of incremental software development. In incremenental, "design and development are broken down into a series of increments [hence its name] that are each developed in turn."" Sommerville describes it as a hybrid between the waterfall method of yesteryore and an evolutionary approach. The process begins when customers identify and prioritize their requirements. Programmers then work on the first, and most important, requirement, and after they have delivered that part, they can begin working on the next aspect. In this model, customers "can take early delivery of [the most important] part[s] of the system functionality." In addition, incremental forces the users to be involved in development because they carry the responsibility of providing feedback on increments as they are delivered.</p>

    <p>Rapid software developpment was created independently by the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, and the Clash during the early 1970s. The aim of RAD is to produce a working system quickly. According to the study guide, RAD is premised on the following: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>It is impossible to specify complex requirements in advance</li>
      <li>Must distance itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock</li>
      <li>Design and testing is iterative</li>
      <li>The application is its own model. You don't need lots of diagrams and flow charts because the code and comments will light your <s>fire</s> understanding.</li>
      <li>Lyrics are frank and confrontational, and they frequently comment on social and political issues.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Like its philosophical predecessor, RAD requires prioritization of user requirements. In a RADian environment, it is preferable to drop requirements than miss deadlines. The study guide suggests that requirements are divvied up into boxes such as "Must have," "Should have," "Could have," and "Won't have."  At heart of RAD is the idea that 80% of the product requires only 20% of the work, and so developers should focus on that part first before moving on to the harder edge cases of the system.</p>

  <h3>Compared to Spiral</h3>

  <p>Now I am going to compare RAD to the sprial development model, so called because development "spirals outwards from an initial outline through to the final developed system." In this model, a spiral represents " a phase of the development process," such as feasibility, requirements, design, etc.</p>

  <p>According to Sommerville, each loop is split into four parts.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Define Objectives</b> - developers establish their objectives for hte loop, identify constraints and risks and plan alternative strategies.</li>
    <li><b>Risk assessment and Reduction</b> - analyze project risks and mitigate it.</li>
    <li><b>Develop and Validate</b> - Chose a development model for the spiral based on the identified risks. Developers might choose prototyping, waterfall, formal transformation, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Planning</b> - a better name for this step is evaluation because this step is about deciding whether to continue with another loop on the spiral, and if so, then you do the planning. So maybe Evaluation and maybe Planning is a better name. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Two things: first, Boehm (1988) proposed the idea of the spiral model. Second, the key difference between Spiral and all the other girls is "the explicit recognition of risk." Examples of risk include using a new programming language, schedule or cost overruns, compilers are unreliable, etc.</p>

  <p>The practice exam question asks me to compare the two methods: Spiral vs. RAD, but I'm too tired to do that now. So instead I will leave with the wise words from Sommerville, who said that he felt that incremental development "is a far better approach to development for most businesses, e-commerce and personal systems because it reflects the fundamental way that we all tend to solve problems. We rarely work out a complete problem solution in advance but move towards a solution in a series of steps, backtracking when we realize that we have made a mistake."</p>
