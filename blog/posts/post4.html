<p>"A tree is a non-linear data structure in which items are arranged in a sorted sequence.  It is used to represent hierarchical relationship existing amongst several data items."</p>

<p>Trees are described as "probably the most fundamental structure in computing."</p>

<p>It is an abstract data type or data structure.  The tree data structure is usually depicted as an inverted tree, i.e., with the root at the top of the diagram and the branches extended downward.  The top bubble represents the root node. Additionally, the terms of child and parent are frequently used to described the relationships among the nodes. Given two connected nodes, the parent is the one closest to the root (higher on the structure) and the child is farther (lower). The terminology remains consistent when describing nodes from the same parent (siblings) and a node that is reached by going up the line (ancestor) or down the line (descendant).</p>

<p>There are a whole bunch of types of trees.  For example, there is a binary tree.  In a binary tree, every node has at most two children and every node is labeled as being either a left or a right child.</p>
