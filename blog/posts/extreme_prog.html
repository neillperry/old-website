  <h1>Extreme Programming</h1>
	<aside>May 12, 2017</aside>
    <p><em>Unless otherwise noted, all quotes are from Sommerville 2007.</em></p>

    <p>Janice left me. Again. For another software engineering process.  Damn it all to hell! How could she walk out after all we've built these forty years. <em>Sob</em></p>

    <p>Said she's tired of waterfall. Too stale. Boring. Said she needs excitement in her life. <em>Sob!</em> What am I going to tell the kids, COBOL and FORTRAN?? Sorry guys, looks like Mommy just doesn't love you. Wecome to life.</p>

    <p>After all I've done. What's wrong with waterfall? It's predictable. Solid. Linear. You do things in order, once. Establish user requirements in detail at the very beginning. Design system architecture, implement and integrate with testing on the side, and then you deliver. You complete each phase before moving on to the next one. It's the perfect way to go when requirements are well understood and unlikely to change. But Janice changed. It got to where I didn't even recognize her anymore.</p>

    <p>/pulls out bottle of cheap gin from night stand.</p>

		<p>Waterfall wins the race. It allows you to agree on project specifications in advance, so you know what you're getting. It allows you to estimate the work at the beginning instead of winging it as you go. Do you think those Agile, Scrume, Extreme Programmers will do taht for you, Janice!?! Huh? Do you!</p>

    <p>There were warning signs, of course. By locking in the requirements so early in the process, you set yourself up for failure. You might end up with bad code or features that don't work. And then your <s>wife</s> customer isn't happy. It also entails complex implementation and limited customer contact.</p>

		<p>I'm staring out the dark window now. There's an empty bottle of gin in my hand, and a fading cigarette on my lips. I sent the kids to my mother's house. I couldn't tell them the truth. That their mother switched to Extreme Programmaing.</p>

		<p>Extreme Programming. It sounds stupid. Like some marketing company came up with it in 1995 or something. But it's real. It's most famou and popular of among the agile family. It embodies some basic principles:</p>

		<ul>
		 <li>Small, frequent releases. Develop requirements based on customer stories or scenarios.</li>
		 <li>Extensive customer involvement. According to Sommerville, "the customer representative takes part in the development."</li>
		 <li>Pair programming, collective ownership of the code and sustainable development (no excessive hours)</li>
		 <li>test-first development and continuous integration</li>
		 <li>constant refactoring to improve code quality and relying on simple designs</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Customers are <em>intimately</em> involved in the process. That's where Janice and I went wrong. Waterfall was too stand-offish for her. Sommerville suggests having a customer available full time, even working on site! Customers and developer create stories that enapsulate what the customer needs, and the developers use those stories to figure out tasks.</p>

		<p>Extreme Programming, or XP as the kids call it these days, takes an extreme approach to iterative development. When a programmer builds a new version, she must run all tests - both for the new feature as well as preexisting tests - to make sure they pass. [This is something I've actually done.] In fact, the study guide says that XP is focuses on unit / functional testing.</p>

		<p>Extreme programming involves 'constant communication.' Ugh. There's that word. Janice and I never talked. We stopped talking to each other years ago.</p>

		<p>One difference between waterfall and XP is their concern for changes. In traditional software engineering, programmers anticipate future changes and design their codebase to facilitate adjustments. XPers don't. Why waste your time worrying about changes that may never happen, they say. Instead, just focus on constantly refactoring the code to make it easier to implement whatever changes do come your way. More flexible approach.</p>

		<p>Maybe if I had done some refactoring in my own life, Janice wouldn't have left me. Again. For another engineering process.</p>
